# Nessus Vulnerability Management

## Introduction

In this project, I used Microsoft Azure and Nessus to demonstrate the full vulnerability management process, from identification to remediation. I deployed a vulnerable virtual machine intentionally configured with outdated software to simulate real-world scenarios and set up a Vulnerability Management Scanner. Using both unauthenticated and credentialed scans, I identified vulnerabilities, implemented remediations, and verified the fixes through follow-up scans.
